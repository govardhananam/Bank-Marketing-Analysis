The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
Import the datset and python note book into google collab or Jupytr Notebook and RUN.

# If the python notebook doesn't load

Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb") there and then you get "http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb"
This site nbviewer works independently of github.

If some notebook rendered in nbviewer appears different from rendered in github, then append "?flush_cache=true" to the end of the nbviewer version url to force it to rerender.
e.g.
http://github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb
becomes
http://github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb?flush_cache=true
